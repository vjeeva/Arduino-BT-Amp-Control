# Arduino-BT-Amp-Control

Arduino with companion Android app to control my Alpine MRP-M1000 Subwoofer amplifier. There is one servo as of now to control the Gain knob and a relay to control the remote wire on the amplifier. A Bluetooth HC-05 module communicates with the Android app for commands to turn the amplifier on and off, and the angle for the servo to turn to on the gain knob.
