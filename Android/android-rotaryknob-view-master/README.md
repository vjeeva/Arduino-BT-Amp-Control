# android-rotaryknob-view
Here's a new dynamic control for Android: a Rotary Knob. It can be used to adjust a value similar to a slider, but it is circular and has a certain advantage when it comes to aesthetics.

Additionally it can be made to accept clicks, so besides working as a slider it can also function as a button. Either a momentary push button or a switch that can be toggled on or off.
